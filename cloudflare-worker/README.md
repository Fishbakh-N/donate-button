# Donate Button Cloudflare Worker

Handles requests to `https://assets.every.org/donate-button/*`, to decide what
version of the bundle to serve to library users.

Based on `workers-typescript-template`, and depoyed with Cloudflare Worker's
build tool, [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler).

### What it does

As of 2020-01-28, we serve the actual built JavaScript bundles from
`https://assets.every.org/donate-button-v2` (replace `v2` with whatever major
version you wish to use), via Github Pages. This worker just lets requests like
that pass through freely.

However, if a request goes to a url matching
`https://assets.every.org/donate-button/:slug/*`, there is no version specified.
If that slug has never been accessed before, it will proxy the latest version
and associate the slug with that version in Cloudflare KV. Therefore, any future
requests to any url under `/donate-button/:slug`, will always resolve to the
same version of the bundle, but we reserve the ability to update individual
clients on their behalf.

### üë© üíª Developing

The entry point for this Cloudflare Worker is
[`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts), and is written in TypeScript. We recommend
developing with VSCode - it is configured to work well out of the box, and
will suggest you useful extensions to aid in your development.

Feel free to make pull requests that update how this code works.

### üß™ Testing

Run `yarn test` to run the test suite. It mocks the service-worker context that
Cloudflare emulates to allow testing locally.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Linting

This project uses [`xo`](https://github.com/xojs/xo) to lint and format the
project.

```
yarn lint      # lint
yarn lint:fix  # auto-format
```

### üëÄ Previewing and Publishing

For information on how to preview and publish your worker, please see the
[Wrangler docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/commands/#publish).

To publish, you will need edit access to Cloudflare; please ask a maintainer for
permission.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats

The `service-worker-mock` used by the tests is not a perfect representation of the Cloudflare Workers runtime. It is a general approximation. We recommend that you test end to end with `wrangler dev` in addition to a [staging environment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/configuration/environments/) to test things before deploying.
